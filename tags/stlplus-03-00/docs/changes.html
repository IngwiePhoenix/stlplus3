<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is an attempt to document all the changes made to the STLplus library.
However, the change log has been restarted for version 3 of the library since the changes
for this version are huge. Therefore only the changes since then have been documented.</p>

<p>The official open-source version of STLplus starts at version 2.0 and you can access the
change log for all version 2 releases by looking at the version 2 documentation.</p>

<p>Only the numbered versions from 2.0 upwards are available as downloads. The very latest
version is only available through CVS and is subject to change. Pre-version 2.0 are not
available from SourceForge.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> STLplus version 3 is <b>not</b> backwards-compatible with STLplus version 2. You should only make
the changeover if you are prepared to do some porting work or if you are starting a new project.</p>

<p><b>Use at Your Own Risk:</b> STLplus version 3.0 is classified as an <b>alpha</b> release. Although
it is based on STLplus, which was a stable release, there is enough reworking for all sorts of
errors to have crept in. Furthermore, I have not yet ported any significant applications to version
3, so only small test programs have been written so far.</p>

<h2 id="v2">Changes from Version 2 to 3.0</h2>

<h3>Split the library into a Collection</h3>

<p>The original STLplus was a single, rather large, library. It has now been split into 5 libraries.
So STLplus is now referred to as a Library Collection, containing within it the STLplus <a
href="containers.html">containers</a>, <a href="portability.html">portability</a>, <a
href="persistence.html">persistence</a>, <a href="subsystems.html">subsystems</a> and <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> libraries.</p>

<h3>Added the stlplus Namespace</h3>

<p>All of the components in the STLplus library collection now have their own namespace - stlplus.
Thus, the smart_ptr class is now stlplus::smart_ptr.</p>

<h3>Removed TextIO</h3>

<p>STLplus had it's own I/O subsystem for historical reasons. That was OK when I was the only user,
but a bit much for new users to be expected to accept. I decided that TextIO had to go, but needed
to wait for other major changes to justify a change that makes the library not backwards
compatible.</p>

<p>STLplus version 3 does not have the TextIO subsystem any more - all functions using TextIO have
been rewritten to use IOStream.</p>

<h3>Removed string_arithmetic</h3>

<p>The string_arithmetic package was an anachronism - it was part of another project which seemed
suitable for inclusion into STLplus, but now seems not to fit. So I have removed it.</p>

<h3>Renamed error_handler to message_handler</h3>

<p>The old name error_handler I think confused people as to the purpose of this component. Since
STLplus 3 is not compatible with previous versions, I am taking this opportunity to rename it to
better reflect its purpose - <a href="message_handler.html">message_handler</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe Iterators</h3>

<p>Iterators in the STL are badly designed - there are several major pitfalls with using them as a
result of their design. However, I wanted STLplus to feel like the STL to make it easier to use, so
felt I should use the iterator concept despite the problems associated with them. Some of the
STLplus components therefore also use iterators.</p>

<p>In STLplus 2 I included some error checking for misuse of iterators. In STLplus 3 I have
completed the job - so I have termed the STLplus iterators <a href="safe_iterators.html">safe
iterators</a>.</p>

<h3>Changed Interfaces to enable Namespace Support</h3>

<p>The old STLplus used a technique for writing template functions that required external resources
to be in the global namespace. This approach is not compatible with placing all of the STLplus into
a separate namespace. All these functions have been rewritten to take an extra parameter so
that those external resources are now passed as parameters.</p>

<p>This rewrite applies to the <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a> library and the <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> library.</p>

<h3>Persistence Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 relied on overloading the functions dump and restore to implement persistence. However,
because of the redesign of the functions discussed above, persistence functions are now passed as
parameters to other persistence functions. To avoid ambiguity, all persistence functions now have
unique names - dump_<i>type</i> and restore_<i>type</i>. See the <a
href="persistence.html">persistence library</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the persistence file format is unchanged by this rewrite, so STLplus version 2 files
can be read by version 3 and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Print and String-Conversion Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 string_utilities also relied on overloading the functions print and to_string to
provide printing and formatting functions for whole data structures. However, because of the
redesign of the functions discussed above, functions are now passed as parameters to other
functions. To avoid ambiguity, all print and string-formatting functions now have unique names -
print_<i>type</i> and <i>type</i>_to_string. See the <a href="strings.html">strings library</a> for
more information.</p>
