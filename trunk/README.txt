This directory is for implementing STLplus as a library collection. The
libraries are to be found in the directories:

          containers
          persistence
          portability
          strings
          subsystems

The documentation is in the 'docs' directory and starts with index.html.

To build the STLplus3 library collection, use the project files supplied at
this level - 'Makefile' for gcc, 'stlplus3.sln' for Visual Studio 9 (2008),
'stlplus3.dsw' for Visual Studio 6 (and 7 or 8).

The 'source' directory is provided with script files that allow the library
collection to be merged into one large library - termed the monolithic build.
See source/README.txt for instructions.
