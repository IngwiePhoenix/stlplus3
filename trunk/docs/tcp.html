<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This package provides simple, clean and platform-independent interfaces to
the Internet protocols provided by TCP. The motivation for writing it was to
make these protocols more accessible to the developer. The underlying
mechanisms for TCP are very low level and unnecessarily complicated. These
classes encapsulate the essence of TCP in three very simple to use classes.</p>

<p>There are two 'ends' to an internet connection, known as the client and the
server. A client is a program that requests a connection whilst a server
provides that connection. In most cases, developers will only be interested in
the client side, since that is all that is needed to build a web browser, news
reader, mail reader etc.. However, this package also provides the server
classes that would be required to build a web server, news server, mail server
etc..</p>

<p>The TCP classes only provide the underlying transport mechanism of TCP. It
does not provide the information protocols such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet etc.
These information protocols could be provided as additional classes layered
onto the TCP classes. For example, an HTTP client class could be layered onto
the TCP client class.</p>


<h2 id="client">TCP Client</h2>

<p>The interface to the TCP_client class is shown below.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class TCP_client
{
public:
  TCP_client(void);
  TCP_client(const std::string&amp; address, unsigned short port, unsigned int timeout=0);
  ~TCP_client(void);

  TCP_client(const TCP_client&amp;);
  TCP_client&amp; operator=(const TCP_client&amp;);

  int error(void) const;
  std::string message(void) const;
  bool initialise(const std::string&amp; address, unsigned short port, unsigned int timeout=0);
  bool initialised(void) const;
  bool connected(void);
  unsigned long address(void) const;
  unsigned short port(void) const;
  bool send_ready(unsigned wait = 0);
  bool send (std::string&amp; data);
  bool receive_ready(unsigned wait = 0);
  bool receive (std::string&amp; data);
  bool close(void);
};
</pre>

<p>There are two ways of creating a TCP client connection. You can either
create an uninitialised client (calling the void constructor) and then
initialise it later, or you can initialise the connection at construction time
and then later test to see if the connection initialised correctly. In the
former case, the initialise function will return true if the initialisation
succeeded and false otherwise. In the latter case, constructors cannot return
a result so you must call the initialised test to see if the connection
initialised correctly. If the connection fails, the error function will give
an error code corresponding to the cause for the failure and the message
function will give a textual representation of the error.</p>

<p>The initialise function (and the second constructor) takes three arguments.
The first is the internet address to connect to, either as a name (e.g.
stlplus.sourceforge.net) or as a number (e.g. 195.0.0.1) and the second is the port
to connect to (e.g. 80 for the HTTP service). The third argument is a timeout clause: if the
connection can't be made in this time (measured in <em>micro</em>-seconds) then the connection
fails. However, if the timeout is set to 0 (the default), then the client implements a non-blocking
connection which then needs to be polled by calling the connected method to determine when it is
connected. Non-blocking operation is suited to applications such as GUIs where other operations need
to be performed in parallel with TCP operations.</p>

<p>The TCP client class supports assignment. This is done using a <a
href="smart_ptr.html">smart pointer</a> to the underlying data structures. Thus,
when you assign TCP clients, you simply create multiple pointers to the same
data structure. There is no way of having more than one client class for a
single connection.</p>

<p>This support for assignment makes it easy to create data structures of TCP
clients. For example, to support multiple simultaneous connections, you could
have an STL vector of TCP_client objects. Each object could be created outside the
vector, initialised and then only copied into to the vector if initialisation
worked.</p>

<p>Once a client connection is finished with, it should be closed by calling
close. The destructor also calls close, so allowing the client object to be
destroyed will close the connection automatically.</p>

<p>The address and port methods allow access to these connection details once
the connection has been made.</p>

<p>The remaining functions actually perform the communication phase of the
connection. All communications are done in non-blocking mode, so these
functions will not block and therefore will not lock up the program. However,
this means that you have to be prepared to retry.</p>

<p>To send data down the connection to the server, use the send function. The
string passed to send is consumed by the send function. In other words, if you
pass a string of, say, 1k bytes and only 100 bytes can be sent at once, the
first 100 bytes of the string will be erased to indicate that they've been
sent. You should repeat the send until the whole string has been consumed. The
send function returns false only if an error occurred - failure to send
because the server is not ready does <em>not</em> class as an error. All that
will happen there is that the function will return true but the string will
still contain the same data. You should retry, possibly after a short
delay.</p>

<p>You can use the send_ready function to determine whether the server is
ready to receive what you send and then call send to actually send the data.
Note that you can call send on its own and it will check whether the server is
ready for you. The send_ready function allows you to specify a time delay to
wait for the server to become ready if it is not at the time of the call. This
delay is specified in micro-seconds (so giving the delay the value 1000000
will cause a delay of 1s). Setting the delay to zero will simply test whether
the server is ready <em>now</em>. This is a non-blocking test which will be the best choice if you are using
the TCP classes as part of a bigger program such as a GUI where there are
other things to deal with, or if you are trying to poll multiple connections.
If the server is not ready after this time delay has expired, the send_ready
function will return false to indicate not ready. If the server becomes
available at any time during the time delay, the timer will be stopped and the
function will return true immediately, it will not wait for the full delay
before returning.</p>

<p>A similar argument applies to the receive and receive_ready functions.
Calling receive_ready checks whether there is any server data ready to be
received by the client. If it is, then receive will collect it. You may need
to keep calling receive to get all the data (the exact method for determining
whether all data has been received depends on the protocol). Bear in mind that
network delays mean that, even if receive_ready returns false, that doesn't
mean all the data has been received, simply that no data has arrived within
the timeout period. Again, receive_ready can be used with little or no timeout
to prevent blocking of the program and once again, there is no point calling
receive_ready with zero timeout since you might as well just call receive.</p>

<p>The receive function appends data received to the string passed as its
argument, so you can allow the data to accumulate over many calls to receive.
On reading the contents of the string, you can then clear the string ready to
receive the next batch of data.</p>

<p>If the server closes the connection, the client will detect the closure
either when a send fails or at the end of receiving data from the server. The
client receive/send functions will automatically close the client end of the
connection, at which point the client will become uninitialised. Therefore the
initialised function should be called to detect this situation.</p>

<p>In typical use, the connection should be first initialised and then any
acceptance message received from the server. Whether there is such a message
depends on the protocol. For example, the NNTP protocol for news sends a
welcome message to confirm that the connection is present and that the news
server is responding okay. Then most protocols use a two-way communication,
with the client sending commands to the server and the server responding with
either status codes or data. At the end of the communication, it is usually
the client's job to close the connection, although some protocols such as HTTP
allow the server to close the connection as soon as a request has been
fulfilled.</p>

<p>Here's a simple Telnet-like client program:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "tcp.hpp"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  if (argc != 3)
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: " &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; " &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  else
  {
    // create a client connection
    // the address is specified by command argument 1 and the port
    // specified by argument 2. Use a timeout of 10s.
    TCP_client client(argv[1],(unsigned short)atoi(argv[2]), 10000000);

    // test to see if the connection completed OK within the timeout
    if (!client.initialised())
    {
      std::cerr &lt;&lt; "client failed to initialise" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      return -1;
    }
    if (client.error())
    {
      std::cerr &lt;&lt; "client initialisation failed with error " &lt;&lt; client.error() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      return -1;
    }

    // start processing
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "type in messages, end the connection with EOF" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    for(;;)
    {
      while (client.receive_ready(1000000))
      {
        std::string returned;
        if (!client.receive(returned))
          std::cerr &lt;&lt; "receive failed" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        else
          std::cerr &lt;&lt; "received \"" &lt;&lt; returned &lt;&lt; "\"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      }
      if (!client.initialised())
      {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "connection has closed" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        break;
      }
      std::string message;
      std::cerr &lt;&lt; "command:" &lt;&lt; flush;
      if (!std::getline(fin,message))
      {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "done" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        client.close();
      }
      else
      {
        message += "\r\n";
        while(!message.empty())
        {
          if (!client.send(message))
          {
            std::cerr &lt;&lt; "failed to send message: " &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; std::endl;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>It is common with most internet protocols to use the carriage-return/line-feed
("\r\n") termination of a request as shown in this example.</p>


<h2 id="server">TCP Server</h2>

<p>A TCP Server is a program that spends most of its time doing nothing very
much. It listens to a port, waiting for a client to attempt a connection. When
a connection is attempted, the server creates that connection, reallocates it
to a different port (so the original port is made available again for further
connections), and then goes back to listening again. The connection itself is
then managed separately by a TCP_connection class.</p>

<p>The server interface is shown below:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class TCP_server
{
public:
  TCP_server(void);
  TCP_server(unsigned short port, unsigned short queue);
  ~TCP_server(void);

  TCP_server(const TCP_server&amp;);
  TCP_server&amp; operator=(const TCP_server&amp;);

  bool initialise(unsigned short port, unsigned short queue);
  bool initialised(void) const;
  int error(void) const;
  std::string message(void) const;
  bool close(void);

  bool connection_ready(unsigned wait);
  TCP_connection connection(void);
};
</pre>

<p>There are two ways of creating a TCP server. You can either
create an uninitialised server (calling the void constructor) and then
initialise it later, or you can initialise the server at construction time
and then later test to see if the server initialised correctly. In the
former case, the initialise function will return true if the initialisation
succeeded and false otherwise. In the latter case, constructors cannot return
a result so you must call the initialised test to see if the server
initialised correctly. If the initialisation fails, the error function will give
an error code corresponding to the cause for the failure and the message
function will give a textual representation of the error.</p>

<p>The initialse function (and the second constructor) takes two arguments.
The first is the port number to listen to and the second is the number of
client requests to allow to be queued before rejecting connections.</p>

<p>The TCP server class supports assignment. This is done using a <a
href="smart_ptr.html">smart pointer</a> to the underlying data structures. Thus,
when you assign TCP servers, you simply create multiple pointers to the same
data structure as with the TCP client.</p>

<p>This support for assignment makes it easy to create data structures of TCP
servers. For example, to listen to many different ports, you could have a
vector of TCP_server objects, one for each port being listened to. Each object
could be created outside the vector, initialised and then only copied into to
the vector if initialisation worked.</p>

<p>Once a server is finished with, it should be closed by calling
close. The destructor also calls close, so allowing the server object to be
destroyed will close the listening port automatically.</p>

<p>To accept a connection, you first need to poll the function
connection_ready. If this returns false, then no connections are incoming on
the port so there is nothing to do, but if it returns true it means that at
least one client is trying to connect. In this case the connection can be
accepted by calling the connection function. This returns an object of type
TCP_connection which will be described in the next section. The server object
does not itself handle the connection, that task is entirely delegated to the
TCP_connection object and the server has no further part to play in the
connection.</p>


<h2 id="connection">TCP Connection</h2>

<p>A TCP Connection object is created by a TCP server when accepting a
connection from a client. The connection object manages the server end of that
connection. The interface to the TCP connection is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class TCP_connection
{
public:
  TCP_connection(void);
  ~TCP_connection(void);

  TCP_connection(const TCP_connection&amp;);
  TCP_connection&amp; operator=(const TCP_connection&amp;);

  int error(void) const;
  std::string message(void) const;
  bool initialised(void) const;
  unsigned long address(void) const;
  unsigned short port(void) const;
  bool send_ready(unsigned wait);
  bool send (std::string&amp; data);
  bool receive_ready(unsigned wait);
  bool receive (std::string&amp; data);
  bool close(void);
};
</pre>

<p>You will notice that there is no method provided for initialising a
TCP_connection. This is because these objects can only be created by a
TCP_server. However, if the server creates a connection but that somehow
fails, the initialised function will return false. This is the way to test
whether a connection was accepted properly. Futhermore, if the connection is
ended either by the client disconnected or by closing the connection then the
initialised function will also return false. In any case, if the connection
failed due to an error, the error function will return a non-zero error code
and the message function will give a text representation of that error.</p>

<p>The address and port functions allow details of the connected client to be
examined. The address is an IP address packed into a 32-bit word. The port is
the number of the local port that is serving the connection (remember that the
server listens on a pre-defined port but transfers accepted connections onto
another, arbitrarily chosen port for the duration of that connection.</p>

<p>The connection can be closed at the server end by calling the close
function. This is also called by the destructor, so allowing the connection to
be destroyed also is an effective way of closing the connection.</p>

<p>The remainder of the functions mirror the client data exchange functions.
The send function sends data to the client. If the send succeeds, then the
sent data is removed from the string passed as the argument. You may need to
call send more than once to send the whole string. If the client is not ready
to receive, then send returns true (since no error has occurred), but no data
is removed from the string. You can optionally call send_ready to check
whether calling send would result in something actually being sent. The
send_receive function also gives a mechanism for allowing the program to wait
a time delay before sending, since network traffic is typically slow. This
would be appropriate if you are writing a program that has nothing else to do
but process the connection. However, if you are in a GUI or in a program with
many connections to serve, either no wait or a very small wait should be used.
If no wait is required there is really no point in calling send_ready since
send does not fail if the client is not ready.</p>

<p>A similar argument applies to the receive and receive_ready functions.
Calling receive_ready checks whether there is any client data ready to be
received by the server. If it is, then receive will collect it. You may need
to keep calling receive to get all the data (the exact method for determining
whether all data has been received depends on the protocol). Bear in mind that
network delays mean that, even if receive_ready returns false, that doesn't
mean all the data has been received, simply that no data has arrived within
the timeout period. Again, receive_ready can be used with little or no timeout
to prevent blocking of the program and once again, there is no point calling
receive_ready with zero timeout since you might as well just call receive.</p>

<p>The receive function appends data received to the string passed as its
argument, so you can allow the data to accumulate over many calls to receive.
On reading the contents of the string, you can then clear the string ready to
receive the next batch of data.</p>

<p>If the client closes the connection, the TCP_connection will detect the
closure either when a send fails or at the end of receiving data from the
client. The connection receive/send functions will automatically close the
server end of the connection, at which point the connection will become
uninitialised. Therefore the initialised function should be called to detect
this situation.</p>
