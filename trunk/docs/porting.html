<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>My intention is to port the screen library to as many platforms as I can reasonably support.
SourceForge help here by allowing access to a wide range of different platforms that I can run
tests on.</p>


<h2 id="issues">Porting Issues</h2>

<p>There are a number of porting issues to be overcome:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Different Operating Systems</dt>

<dd>
<p>One of the objectives of this library is to provide platform-independent
access to operating system services that differ between platforms. The idea is
to hide the implementation behind a common interface. By writing software to
that interface, you automatically get portable software. At least, that is the
theory.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Different CPU Architectures</dt>
<dd>
<p>Different CPUs have different word lengths, different byte ordering and different integer type
definitions. The intention is that STLplus will work with all variations of these characteristics
that I come across.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Different Compilers</dt>

<dd>
<p>The concept of portability means portability between operating systems, not necessarily
portability between compilers. However, to cater for different tastes in compilers, under Windows
the library will work for either the Gnu gcc compiler or the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Different Compiler Versions</dt>

<dd>
<p>It is also important that software will build with different versions of each compiler, because I
have no control over which compiler you are using and there's a good chance that you don't either.
The STLplus library should ideally work in whatever development environment you have chosen (within
reason). So, STLplus works with different releases of these compilers, not just the latest one. At
the time of writing STLplus builds with all versions of gcc from version 2.95 up to 3.4 and has been
reported as working with version 4. It also works with Visual Studio versions 6, 7 and 8 although I
only supply project files for v6.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>I refer to a "platform" as a particular combination of CPU, Operating System and Compiler.</p>


<p>These requirements create some limitations on the extent of the library - the primary objective
is for it to be portable such that it presents exactly the same interface on all platforms. This
means that I do not have anything that cannot be implemented on all platforms with all supported
compilers.</p>

<p>For example there's no Unicode support because some compilers have little or no support for
Unicode and there are major differences in how Unicode is implemented on different operating
systems. There are other libraries that deal with this issue better than I can and so I consider it
beyond the scope of the STLplus library to resolve it.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Porting Progress</h2>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, which hosts STLplus, used to provide a Compile
Farm so that I could test STLplus on different platforms. This enabled me, for example, to fix
problems with data persistence on 64-bit CPUs. Unfortunately, the Compile Farm has now been
withdrawn, so I can only test the library on my Windows machine. However, I can still test against
Cygwin Unix emulation on Windows, and Windows native builds using Visual Studio, the MinGW version
of the Gcc compiler and the Cygwin gcc compiler running in native mode (gcc v3 only).</p>

<p>In the past, the STLplus library has been compiled with gcc versions 2.95 to 4.3, with Visual
Studio versions from 6 (SP5) to 8 (2005 Express Edition) and it reportedly works with the Borland
compiler. It has been built on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures (Intel, AMD, IBM OpenPower, Sun
Sparc) running Windows (NT/2000/XP) Linux (Debian, RedHat, Suse), other Unix (Open BSD, Net BSD,
Free BSD, Solaris) and MacOS X (Darwin).

<p>If you can confirm the library works on any other platform or compiler combination, please let me
know the details - Compiler, Compiler version, OS, CPU etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows the platforms that STLplus3 has been tested on recently.</p>

<p><b>Note 1</b>: The -D directive is a C macro that selects between different implementations of
code for different platforms. For example, a Windows application will use different system calls to
a Unix application. The correct directive for the platform must be defined for the STLplus library
to build on the target platform. Typically this is set as an option to the compiler - for example
with the gcc compiler you would specify "<tt>gcc -DSOLARIS</tt>" when building on Solaris. The
_WIN32 value that selects the Windows native build is set automatically by the compilers so you
don't have to do this. If no -D directive is shown, then the default build is a generic Unix build
and needs no special rules. See the documentation on <a href="building.html">building the
library</a> for more on this.</p>
