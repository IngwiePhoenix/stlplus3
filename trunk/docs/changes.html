<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is an attempt to document all the changes made to the STLplus library.
However, the change log has been restarted for version 3 of the library since the changes
for this version are huge. Therefore only the changes since then have been documented.</p>

<p>The official open-source version of STLplus starts at version 2.0 and you can access the change
log for all version 2 releases by looking at the 
<a href="http://stlplus.sourceforge.net/stlplus/docs/changes.html">version 2 documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v3.3">Changes from Version 3.2 to 3.3</h2>


<h2 id="v3.2">Changes from Version 3.1 to 3.2</h2>

<h3>Added dynaload class to portability library</h3>

<p>This class is a platform-independent and object-oriented interface to the dynamic library loader
functions.</p>

<h3>Softened dependencies on the portability library</h3>

<p>I have modified the persistence and strings libraries so that the dependency on the portability
library is soft not hard. This means that both libraries can be compiled without the portability library if
you don't want persistence or printing support for the portability/inf type.</p>

<h3>Made the Containers Library an 'Include-only' Library</h3>

<p>The containers library had only one component that needed compiling - the rest of the library is
template code that gets included in your code. I have inlined the one component (the exception
classes) so that the library is entirely headers and does not need compiling.</p>

<p>This change also required changes to the makefiles project, so if you are using my makefiles you
will need to download the latest version of that too (i.e. at least v1.4).</p>

<h3>Use ANSI-Specific Functions on Windows</h3>

<p>The STLplus library does not support Unicode (for good reasons - the wide string class is too
weakly defined to have a common cross-platform interpretation). However, it should be usable in
a system that does. I have modified the Windows system calls to always call the ANSI variants and use
narrow strings even when compiled with the UNICODE macro enabled.</p>

<h3>File Mode Function Removed</h3>

<p>The function file_set_mode has been removed because it is non-portable and there's no way to make
it portable. It was legacy code from a Unix-only project and didn't work on Windows. For the time
being, use the platform specific functions for this. In the future I may re-introduce a limited
functionality interface to the file modes once I can work out the common subset.</p>

<h2 id="v3.1">Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.1</h2>

<h3>Bug in subsystems/cli_parser</h3>

<p>The macro END_CLI_DEFINITIONS contained an error with namespaces - so it would only work if you
were "using namespace stlplus". This should now work when using the stlplus:: prefix notation as
well.</p>

<h3>Bug in subsystems/cli_parser</h3>

<p>There was a bug related to the use of a definition_t to define a command-line argument. The bug
caused the cli_parser to crash with a segmentation fault due to a null pointer being passed to a
std::string.</p>

<h3>Built-in messages in subsystems/message_handler</h3>

<p>The minimum set of messages (for the cli_handler) has now been built-in to the message_handler so
that applications can more easily be built with no message-file handling.</p>

<h3>Bug in Windows port of quoted command-line arguments in portability/subprocesses.</h3>

<p>This bug resulted in a quoted string being converted by the argument_vector class into a
doubled-up string - i.e. "./fred" would get converted into "..//ffrreedd". The bug only manifested
on Windows.</p>

<h3>Change to kill semantics in portability/subprocesses</h3>

<p>A bug fix was submitted by Alistair Low to enable the subprocess classes to kill a whole
subprocess tree rather than just the parent process. I have yet to confirm whether this is the
behaviour of the Unix port - it should be.</p>

<h3>Bug in portability/debug</h3>

<p>One of the macros in the debug header had a typo - which broke the debug utilities. The symptom
was in DEBUG_TRACE which would result in a compilation error due to a reference to the undefined
class stlplus_debug_trace. This has been fixed.</p>

<h3>Change to implementation of portability/debug</h3>

<p>The string formatting was being done by string-stream classes. I have
rewritten it to use the more efficient portability/dprintf.</p>

<h3>Changes to subsystems/cli_parser use of susbsystems/ini_manager</h3>

<p>The CLI Parser loads default values from the Ini Manager. However, in
previous versions, it was possible for a typo to mean that an option was
ignored. I have now added error checking so that all variables in the relevant
section of the Ini Manager are recognised as command-line options.</p>

<p>An extra error message has been added to messages/stlplus_messages.txt to
report this error.</p>

<h3>Changes to subsystems/ini_manager to improve error reporting</h3>

<p>The Ini Manager now keeps track of which line in the Ini file a value comes
from, so that error reporting can report the file name and line number of an
error. The method ini_manager::variable_linenumber has been added for this
purpose.</p>

<h3>Bug Fix in portability/subprocesses</h3>

<p>There was a bug in the quoting code for Windows command-lines which
resulted in quote marks being added after every character in a string that
needed quoting (i.e. contained special characaters). This has been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="v2">Changes from Version 2 to 3.0</h2>

<h3>Split the library into a Collection</h3>

<p>The original STLplus was a single, rather large, library. It has now been split into 5 libraries.
So STLplus is now referred to as a Library Collection, containing within it the STLplus <a
href="containers.html">containers</a>, <a href="portability.html">portability</a>, <a
href="persistence.html">persistence</a>, <a href="subsystems.html">subsystems</a> and <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> libraries.</p>

<h3>Added the stlplus Namespace</h3>

<p>All of the components in the STLplus library collection now have their own namespace - stlplus.
Thus, the smart_ptr class is now stlplus::smart_ptr.</p>

<h3>Removed TextIO</h3>

<p>STLplus had it's own I/O subsystem for historical reasons. That was OK when I was the only user,
but a bit much for new users to be expected to accept. I decided that TextIO had to go, but needed
to wait for other major changes to justify a change that makes the library not backwards
compatible.</p>

<p>STLplus version 3 does not have the TextIO subsystem any more - all functions using TextIO have
been rewritten to use IOStream.</p>

<h3>Removed string_arithmetic</h3>

<p>The string_arithmetic package was an anachronism - it was part of another project which seemed
suitable for inclusion into STLplus, but now seems not to fit. So I have removed it.</p>

<h3>Renamed error_handler to message_handler</h3>

<p>The old name error_handler I think confused people as to the purpose of this component. Since
STLplus 3 is not compatible with previous versions, I am taking this opportunity to rename it to
better reflect its purpose - <a href="message_handler.html">message_handler</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe Iterators</h3>

<p>Iterators in the STL are badly designed - there are several major pitfalls with using them as a
result of their design. However, I wanted STLplus to feel like the STL to make it easier to use, so
felt I should use the iterator concept despite the problems associated with them. Some of the
STLplus components therefore also use iterators.</p>

<p>In STLplus 2 I included some error checking for misuse of iterators. In STLplus 3 I have
completed the job - so I have termed the STLplus iterators <a href="safe_iterator.html">safe
iterators</a>.</p>

<h3>Changed Interfaces to enable Namespace Support</h3>

<p>The old STLplus used a technique for writing template functions that required external resources
to be in the global namespace. This approach is not compatible with placing all of the STLplus into
a separate namespace. All these functions have been rewritten to take an extra parameter so
that those external resources are now passed as parameters.</p>

<p>This rewrite applies to the <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a> library and the <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> library.</p>

<h3>Persistence Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 relied on overloading the functions dump and restore to implement persistence. However,
because of the redesign of the functions discussed above, persistence functions are now passed as
parameters to other persistence functions. To avoid ambiguity, all persistence functions now have
unique names - dump_<i>type</i> and restore_<i>type</i>. See the <a
href="persistence.html">persistence library</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> the persistence file format is unchanged by this rewrite, so STLplus version 2 files
can be read by version 3 and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Print and String-Conversion Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 string_utilities also relied on overloading the functions print and to_string to
provide printing and formatting functions for whole data structures. However, because of the
redesign of the functions discussed above, functions are now passed as parameters to other
functions. To avoid ambiguity, all print and string-formatting functions now have unique names -
print_<i>type</i> and <i>type</i>_to_string. See the <a href="strings.html">strings library</a> for
more information.</p>
